1. implement so that clients can have their own string IDs for identification in the server; ie: "jetson", "pi-navigation", "test", etc. These IDs are stored with a unique ID with the client's information (hostname, address, port, public key (not implemented yet), etc) same as any API server usually would.

2. Implement message scheduler in server. Similar to mavlink, we want certain messages to run at fixed intervals. Schedulers are keyed by the message code. 
* Timers are set in seconds (1.0 = every 1 second, 60.0 = every minute, 0.1 = 10HZ, etc.)
* Only one timer per code can be set. 

api.sched_set(msg=MSP_EXAMPLE, delay=1.0, payload=None)
api.sched_get()
>>> {
    "MSP_EXAMPLE": {"delay": 1.0, "payload": None, "last_time": 1234567890.123}
}
the server automatically sends these messages every interval and caches the replies same as if a client had requested it.

3. api.sched_remove(MSP_CODE)


5. example_client and other clients should only contain example/user specific code and import necessary API functions (ie: MSPServerTransport) from msp_api.py

6. function calls should be like:
_, sensor_config = api.get_sensor_config()
or
info, sensor_config = api.get_sensor_config()
instead of calling _print_diag
info contains information for this call (latency, delay, cached, scheduled, cache age)


4. client queues in case of long delay/dropout (cant remember if this is in already)


7. server diag should contain length of queues for this client, total number of messages queued

8. "cache ttl" is time delay after which a new one must be fetched if demanded, but cache should not be deleted (always preserve last response)
